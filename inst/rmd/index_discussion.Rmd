abstract: " Everyone knows that `bookdown` is an excellent package for authoring books on programming languages. But it is only one side of the coin.  It can do more than expected. Therefore I am developing `bookdownplus`. `bookdownplus` is an extension of `bookdown`. It helps you write academic journal articles, guitar books, chemical equations, mails, calendars, and diaries."
